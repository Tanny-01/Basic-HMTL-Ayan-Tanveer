As a bonus feature which can be found on contact us page as hyperlink to signup page, is that the i've used a toggle method as soon clicked show password, it will appear - unclicked, it will disappear.

Plus i've added a google maps to help users locate cantor college more easily.

Also a login page is added, as is not connected to a backend data a message is displayed "We have run into a problem, Login page will be available soon!!!"
